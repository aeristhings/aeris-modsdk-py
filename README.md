# aeris-modsdk-py
This package is intended to provide both an SDK and CLI for common radio modules.

This is not production code. There is no formal support provided by Aeris for this SDK.


## Getting Started - Install Package

If you want to install and use the package rather than make changes to it, see:

https://github.com/aeristhings/aeris-modsdk-py/wiki

## Getting Started - Development

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to develop and test.

What I'm using:

```
git --version = 2.17.1
python --version = 3.7.5
pip --version = 19.3.1
poetry --version = 1.0.0
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Step 1: Clone the source to your local machine

```
$ git clone https://github.com/aeristhings/aeris-modsdk-py.git

## Running the tests

This section covers the automated tests for this system

### Functional tests

This project uses pytest for running functional tests

```
$ poetry run pytest

### Coding style tests

This project used pycodestyle to ensure adherence to PEP 8 coding style rules.

Running pycodestyle as below should return with no errors.

```
$ pycodestyle --max-line-length=120 aerisapisdk/
```

### Integration tests



## Updating Version Number
Before you build and publish, you will need to make sure that the version is changed so that users can easily pick up the latest version.

You can easily do that via poetry. For example, to increment the patch-level version, issue the command:

```
$ poetry version patch
Bumping version from 0.1.4 to 0.1.5
```


## Building
You can use poetry to build the distribution that we will want to publish to pypi.org. Use the 'build' command.

I have not found a way to clean out the previous build distribution. You may have to manually 'rm -rf dist' to remove before running the build.

```
$ poetry build
Building aerismodsdk (0.1.3)
 - Building sdist
 - Built aerismodsdk-0.1.3.tar.gz

 - Building wheel
 - Built aerismodsdk-0.1.3-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Publishing
The publish command uploads to pypi.org so that users can install via 'pip install' or 'pip install --upgrade'.

```
$ poetry publish

Publishing aerismodsdk (0.1.3) to PyPI
Username: <myusername>
Password:
 - Uploading aerismodsdk-0.1.3-py3-none-any.whl 100%
 - Uploading aerismodsdk-0.1.3.tar.gz 100%
```

## Built With

* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) - Python dependency management
* [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/) - Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces
* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) - Python testing tool that helps you write better programs
* [pycodestyle](http://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html) -  A tool to check Python code against the style conventions in PEP 8
